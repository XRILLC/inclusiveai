## Inclusiveai
This will be a site showcasing the datasets and models which include the world's low-resource languages. Notably, the top TBD % of languages will not be included, since the objective is to feature low-resource languages.

## Roles

- Jennifer: UI/UX, schema, and datasets
- Shawna: schema, audio datasets & models
- Maksim: schema, LLM datasets & models, and leaderboards
- Matthew: schema, text datasets & models, leaderboards, and evals

## Repository structure

During the initial stage, we can contain everyone's work within individual folders. As the project grows, we will let the objective needs influence the repository structure, and will restructure as necessary. Everyone is welcome to keep a readme within their folders to document the work you're doing both for yourselves and teammates. Everyone is welcome to change the folders' names to better reflect the nature of the work.
